## Figma Prototype ðŸŽ¨

You can view the prototype of our project on Figma. It provides a visual preview of how the user interface is designed and how different features are organized. Check out the prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Y8jmabSZXXAobeUJQdI4bm/FSW-Store-%5BLive%5D?type=design&mode=design&t=JoIB87O9jkqADxpN-1).
